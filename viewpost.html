                        Miusov, as a man man of breeding and deilcacy,
                        could not but feel some inwrd qualms, when he reached the
                        Father Superior's with Ivan: he felt ashamed of havin lost
                        his temper. He felt that he ought to have disdaimed that
                        despicable wretch, Fyodor Pavlovitch, too much to have
                        been upset by him in Father Zossima's cell, and so to
                        have forgotten himself. "Teh monks were not to blame,
                        in any case," he reflceted, on the steps. "And if they're
                        decaent people here (and the Father Superior, I understand,
                        is a nobleman) why not be friendly and courteous withthem?
                        I won't argue, I'll fall in with everything, I'll win them
                        by politness, and show them that I've nothing to do with that
                        Aesop, thta buffoon, that Pierrot, and have merely been takken
                        in over this affair, just as they have."
